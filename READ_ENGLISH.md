# CodeView

(my engilsh is not good ,if you have any question,you can ask me by e-mail : thereisnospon@qq.com)

CodeView is a android widget can show code and hightlight it .
The code is rendering by hightlight.js , it  not only can automatically recognize the dominant languages such as java,c++,c#,python,bash,ruby and more..  but also have many kinds of themes you can choose.


example:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <img src="http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160621185326512" width="216"  height="382"/>
    </td>
    <td>
    <img src="http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160621185350184" width="216"  height="382"/>
    </td>
    <td>
    <img src="http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160621185403236" width="216"  height="382"/>
    </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>
    <img src="http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160621185418189" width="216"  height="382"/>
    </td>
    <td>
    <img src="http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160621185434418" width="216"  height="382"/>
    </td>
    <td>
    
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>



it  can not only show code snippet，but also  have replaced all the specified code in the HTML file with highlighted to come out, and the other part keep unchanged.


etc：

## get(gradle)



```
compile 'thereisnospon.codeview:codeview:0.3.1'

```



## use

in the layout:
```xml
 <thereisnospon.codeview.CodeView
        android:id="@+id/codeview"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent">
</thereisnospon.codeview.CodeView>
```
in java code：

```java
 public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    CodeView codeView;
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        codeView=(CodeView)findViewById(R.id.codeview);
        codeView.setTheme(CodeViewTheme.ANDROIDSTUDIO).fillColor();
        //CODE is your code which  you want to show,type is String
        codeView.showCode(CODE);
    }
}
```

then is ok,it can recognize your code language  automatically。

if you want hightlight many code snippet in a html:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title></title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a code</h1>
<pre class="code">
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	printf("hello world");
}
</pre>
<h1>This is another code</h1>
<pre class="code">
class Main
{
	private String name;
	Main(String name){
		this.name=name;
	}
	public static void main(String []args){
		Main main=new Main("hello");
		System.out.println("init");
	}
}
</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

this code snippet both have a same class "code"

you can hightlight them by two ways:


```java
 codeView.showCodeHtmlByClass(Constant.HTML,"code");
```

you can also using css selector ,such as:

```java
 codeView.showCodeHtmlByCssSelect(Constant.HTML,".code");
```

## change theme

default theme is  DEFAULT 。CodeViewTheme is a enum type
```java
 codeView.setTheme(CodeViewTheme.DRACULA)
```
you can using this method to list all themes
```java
 public static CodeViewTheme[]listThemes()；
```
som other methods:
```java
	//set encoding ,utf-8 is default
	public CodeView setEncode(String encode);
	//fill background color
	public CodeView fillColor()；
	//show code ,recognize language automatically。
	public void showCode(String code)；
	//show code and  specifying language,but it is undone.
	public void showCode(Code code)
```

you can clone this project to local,app have som useage demo,you can browse all theme and concreate useage


if you think is interesting ,can give a star

ofcourse ,it is my first open source library,it must have many trouble,and bug,you can give me some addvice,
and then,i can learn more.
